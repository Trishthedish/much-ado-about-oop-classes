# üê∂ Much to do about Object-oriented programming ‚òïÔ∏è
This repo exists for **one reason and one reason only**:  
To teach **curious minds**, how Python classes work ‚Äî and how they can bring **order**, **reusability**, and **readability** into your code.

## But First: What Even Is a Class?
A **class** is like a **recipe**, **blueprint**, **template**, or --better yet -- a **cookie cutter**. 
You don‚Äôt handcraft every cookie from scratch like some kind of chaos gremlin, right?

**No, you're not a monster. You're just trying to bake some clean, reusable code** üç™

Instead of handcrafting every cookie from scratch, you design a reusable shape ‚Äî a **class** ‚Äî
and use it to stamp out as many cookies (aka **objects**) as your heart desires.

With a class, you define how a thing *should* look and behave.
Then, whenever you need a new one, you just stamp out a fresh cookie ‚Äî a.k.a. an **object** ‚Äî with all the right ingredients and abilities built in.

Want a dozen dogs? A fleet of coffee machines? A color-coded army of sock drawers - perfectly organized ?
Make a class. You bring the dough. Python brings the structure. Everyone wins.

In Python:
- A class defines what something **is** and **what it can do**.

- An `object` is a real, working version of that thing, made using the class.

So when you see `class CuteDog`, think:

> ‚ÄúAha! This is the dog-making machine.‚Äù üê∂
> And every time we create a new CuteDog, we‚Äôre rolling out another good boy (or girl) from that mold.

Each dog can have its own name, color, and bark style‚Äîbecause the blueprint is flexible, 
not rigid. Just like a good cookie recipe lets you add extra chocolate chips. üç´

So in summary:

> ‚ÄúClasses give us a way to **group related data and behavior** into one component. Just like a hardware controller manages a part of a device, a class manages a part of a software system. And the beauty is, once we build a class, we can reuse it, upgrade it, or swap it ‚Äî without breaking everything else. That‚Äôs why Object-Oriented Programming is so powerful: it makes our code work like a real system of cooperating modules.‚Äù

Before jumping into how to use this repo. I wanted to also link you to a few other related topics.
- Summary of [Solid Design Principles](solid_design_principles.md)
- Summary of [The 4 Pillars of Object-oriented Programming](the_4_pillars_object_oriented_programming_oop.md)

Both these summaries should help inform you as to why OOP might be a brilliant way to organize and design code. 

With those in mind, I wanted to share with you some of my favorite relevant quotes from **Sandy Metz**, "*Practical Object Oriented Design in Ruby*"
[viewable-pdf-copy-found-here](https://github.com/martinmurciego/good-books/blob/master/Practical%20Object-Oriented%20Design%20in%20Ruby.pdf)

> "Applications that are easy to change are a pleasure to write and joy to extend. There flexible adaptable. Applications that resist change are just the opposite."

> **‚ÄúCode is read more than it is written.‚Äù**  
> This is a classic ‚Äî but Sandi often emphasizes it to remind us that **clarity beats cleverness*

> **‚ÄúThe cost of change is a better measure of software quality than the number of bugs or lines of code.‚Äù**  
It‚Äôs not about how ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù or ‚Äúefficient‚Äù your code looks ‚Äî it‚Äôs about how much it hurts to change it.


## First you must go over Pre-Lesson Checklist
You can check out the Pre Lesson Check List [here](pre_lesson_check_list.md)
After you've accomplished this. You are ready to start using this repo.


## How to Run it
1.  Clone this repo (yes, you‚Äôre using Git now, Steve ‚Äî welcome to the club):
```
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/muchadoaboutoop.git
  cd coffee-machine
```

2. Run the script and watch the magic:
* Stuck with the use of python3, but if you decide to use pyenv - you can decide which precise version of python to use.
In which case, if you have your local or global environment set. You can either use `python <name of python file>.py to run.

```
python3 coffee_machine.py
python3 cute_dog.py
python3 everything_is_an_object_in_oop.py
python3 <name of python file to run>.py
```
3. Want to run tests?

```
python3 -m unittest test_coffee_machine.py
# this one is purposedly broken - so you can see broken test and fix it.
python3 test_cute_dogs.py
python3 test_coffee_machine.py
python3 <name of test python file>.py
```
