# SOLID Design Principles

The **SOLID principles** are _five core design principles_ that make Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) easier to maintain, extend, and refactor. They're like the North Star for writing clean, modular, and scalable code in OOP—especially useful as projects grow in size and complexity.

Here’s a breakdown of each principle with simple meanings, memorable metaphors, and examples:

### 🟡 **S** – Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

**💬 “A class should have only one reason to change.”** — Uncle Bob

#### 👉 What it means:

A class should do **one thing**, and do it **well**. If a class has multiple responsibilities, changing one behavior might break another.

#### ✅ Good Example:

A `ReportGenerator` class _only_ formats reports—not saving, printing, or emailing them. Those are separate responsibilities.

#### 🧠 Analogy:

Think of a **coffee machine**. If it also tried to fix plumbing or play music, it'd be confusing and hard to repair!

---
### 🟢 **O** – Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

**💬 “Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.”**

#### 👉 What it means:

You should be able to **add new behavior** without changing existing code. This avoids breaking what's already working.

#### ✅ Good Example:

A payment system that allows new payment types (e.g., Apple Pay, Crypto) by plugging in new classes instead of editing old ones.

#### 🧠 Analogy:

Think of a **power strip**. You can plug in new devices, but the strip itself doesn’t need to be rewired.

---
### 🔵 **L** – Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

**💬 “Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without breaking the program.”** — Barbara Liskov

#### 👉 What it means:

If `Dog` is a subclass of `Animal`, you should be able to use a `Dog` wherever an `Animal` is expected—**without weird behavior**.

#### ⚠️ Bad Example:

A `Square` subclass that breaks behavior of a `Rectangle` class by assuming width = height.

#### 🧠 Analogy:

If you rent a **car**, you expect any model to drive forward, stop, and turn. You’d be confused if one required flapping wings to go forward.

---
### 🟣 **I** – Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

**💬 “Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.”**

#### 👉 What it means:

Break big, general-purpose interfaces into smaller, more specific ones. This keeps classes from having to implement methods they don’t need.

#### ✅ Good Example:

Instead of one giant `IMachine` interface with `print()`, `scan()`, and `fax()`, split it into `IPrinter`, `IScanner`, and `IFax`.

#### 🧠 Analogy:

Don’t make a **chef** learn to use a DJ controller just because it’s in the employee manual.

---
### 🔴 **D** – Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

**💬 “Depend on abstractions, not concretions.”**

#### 👉 What it means:

High-level modules (business logic) shouldn't directly depend on low-level modules (details). Both should depend on **interfaces or abstractions**.

#### ✅ Good Example:

Instead of a `NotificationSender` class directly using `EmailSender`, it depends on a `Notifier` interface that `EmailSender`, `SMSSender`, etc., can implement.

#### 🧠 Analogy:

Your **TV remote** doesn’t care what brand the TV is—as long as the TV speaks “remote control language.”

### 🎯 Summary Cheat Code:

| Principle | Focus                 | What it Protects You From                   |
| --------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| SRP       | One job per class     | Spaghetti code from trying to do too much   |
| OCP       | Extend, don’t modify  | Breaking old stuff when adding new features |
| LSP       | Respect inheritance   | Surprises in subclass behavior              |
| ISP       | Keep interfaces small | Forcing classes to implement useless stuff  |
| DIP       | Depend on interfaces  | Hard-to-test, tightly coupled code          |
