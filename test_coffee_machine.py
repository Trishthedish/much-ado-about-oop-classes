# This line ensures that our test suite runs *only* when we execute this file directly.
# `__name__` is a special built-in variable in Python. It equals `'__main__'` when the file is run directly,
# like when we do: `python3 test_coffee_machine.py`.
# `unittest.main()` then discovers all classes that inherit from `unittest.TestCase`
# and automatically runs any methods that start with `test_`.
# Without this block, Python will define the tests but wonâ€™t actually run them!
