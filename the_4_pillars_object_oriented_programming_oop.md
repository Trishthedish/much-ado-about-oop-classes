# The 4 Pillars of Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

### 1. *Encapsulation*
    1. **what it is:**  Wrapping data and methods into a single unit (a class) and hiding the internal details
	2. **why it matters**: Prevents outside code from messing with your data directly.
	3. **Think of it like**: A vending machine --you press a button (method), but you don't get to reach inside and grab the snacks (private data)!

### 2. *Abstraction*:
    1. **What it is**: Hiding complex implementation and exposing only the useful parts.
	2. **Why it matters**: Makes it easier for people to use your code without needing to know how it all works. 
	3. **Think of it like**:  A common person Driving a car -- you turn the wheel and press pedals without needing to know how the engine or break system actually works.

### 3. *Inheritance*:
    1. **What it is**:  A child class can inherit features from parent class. 
	2. **Why it matters**: Avoids repeating code, and lets you build on existing functionality.
	3. **Think of it like:** *A company uniform* — employees in different departments (sales, support, engineering) wear the same shirt (shared behavior), but they each have their own tools or responsibilities (custom features). They “inherit” the base employee gear, but can specialize.

### 4. *Polymorphism*:
    1. **What it is**: Different objects can use the same method name, but behave differently. 
	2. **Why it matters**: Lets you write flexible, reusable code that works with multiple types.
	3. **Think of it like**: A “Print” button — when clicked in different apps, it prints a document, a photo, or a spreadsheet.  Same action, but the result depends on the context.
